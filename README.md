#cnnrnn text classification of tensorflow

#This code belongs to the "Implementing a CNN for Text Classification in Tensorflow" blog post

#I modified it to deal with Chinese text classification and add a cnn-rnn model in it.

#And I add a rnn model with attention, rnn-cnn model, cnn-rnn model and cnn concat rnn model to compare different model effect.

#The experiment shows that cnn concat rnn model did best and then cnn model.
